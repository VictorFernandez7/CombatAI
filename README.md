# CombatAI
Machine learning testing for a 2D combat game

The main concept is to fight an enemy with the same abilities as the player. This AI will have memory so the player has to use different types of attacks/moves to defeat it. For example, if the player uses the same attack consecutively the AI will react either blocking or parrying.
